## Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard 

### Purpose 
This dashboard assists in visualizing the top bacterial species of data for each volunteer. By selecting the Test Subject ID you can view the data related to each volunteer.

### Files
- index html - basic html and layout 
- charts.js - javascript files with event handling and chart creation functions 
- style.css - basic style sheet
